## Features
* Play battleship by tagging a discord user
* check your account balance

### Commands
* help
* import-wallet pk
* register-wallet
* balance
* battleship @discorduser

In a public channel, you can use the these commands.
You can also use these commands in a private DM channel with the bot.

## Architecture
### DiscordId -> Public Key Storage
This is a persistent db. All it does is map discordIds to public keys. A user can use a command
to save a public key for their discordId here. Then, users can send that user currency by simply
tagging them in a message instead of having to write the public key.
### Wallet
Regular wallet offering functions such as inspecting balance or sending currency. Forwards calls to
the selected Solana cluster.
### PriceAPI
Provides the current USD value of SOL and some other price-related functions.
